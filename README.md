## Files
```
1. train_and_deploy-solution.ipynb: this is a notebook that contains code for training and deploying a computer vision model on AWS
2. hpo.py: a Python script that train_and_deploy-solution.ipynb notebook can use as its "entry point."
3. train.py: Script for training the final model
4. infernce2.py: this is a Python file that use for deploying your trained model to an endpoint
5. ec2train1.py: this is a Python file that use for training a model on an EC2 instance
6. lambdafunction.py: this is a starter Python script that you can use for your Lambda function - remember, it will take a few adjustments before it functions correctly as a Lambda function
```
